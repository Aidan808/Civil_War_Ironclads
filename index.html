		<h3>Have you ever wondered how our modern day battleships came to be? Well Alex, Caleb and I wondered that too! Thats why we really enjoyed this project. My favorite part was coding this project, because I've never coded for a school activity before! We chose this topic because it is really interesting. Did you know that the Monitor had the first toilet, and the first rotating turret? The thing I wanted to know when I started researching this topic was what are ironclads? I can't believe I've never heard of ironclads before this project.

		<h3>Alex, Caleb and I are presenting separately, to cover more about ironclads. Below are pictures of the USS Monitor and CSS Virginia with captions. An ironclad is a ship coated in metal, usually for protection. This metal coat protect the crew, and turned the iron clad into a wepon. Now the ironclad can ram a wooden ship, without risking damaging itself. Ironclads are the predictors of our modern day warships.</h3>
