This was an exciting challenge as I've never coded for a school activity before!</h3> 
		<h3 id="work">The predecessors to our modern day warships were called the ironclads. What made the ironclads so special? The ironclads were the first class of warships to utilize metal as an exoskeleton for defense and strength. This metal exterior protected the crew from enemy fire, and the ship itself from shelling. This hardened framework also transformed these wooden ships into floating tanks, that could inflict significant damage by ramming into other ships.
